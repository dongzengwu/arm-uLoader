\chapter{CMSIS}
CMSIS is a huge advantage in code portability. The idea behind that standardized
interface is to make the programmer independet of the hardware. Thus CMSIS is a
hardware abstraction layer.\\
The programmer developes code to access the CMSIS driver library instead of the
hardware. This way the code becomes portable for all CORTEX MCU's.
