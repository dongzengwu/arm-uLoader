\section{introduction}
The aim of the project is to research on the feasibility to create a quick cheap
 and easy to use way of utilizing an STM32 Micro controller to communicate
 between a user and a remote device. The purpose of the application is meant
 to be a first step fundamental strategy to creating a product for future
 projects. It is hoped that by way of HTML communication, a fast and light
 application could be used to fulfill the desire of a user to achieve a
 particular objective such as threeway handshake signal to verify a particular
 device in order to transmit information such as codes or messages, using a
 TCP/IP protocol stake. As can be demonstrated the different applications could
 be endless.
